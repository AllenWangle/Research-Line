DKN is a content-based recomendation framework for click-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and word-entity-aligned knoledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that fuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. More specific, KCNN treats words and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keep their alignment relationship during convolution. In addition, to address users' diverse interests, the model also uses an attention module to dynamically aggregate a user's history with respect to current candidate news.

**Problem defination**. The news recomendation is quite difficult as it poses three major challenges.
  1. news article are highly time-sensitive and their relevance expirs quickly within a short period.
  2. people are topic-sensitive in news reading as they usually intrested in multiple specific news categories. How to dynamically measure a user's interest based on his diversified reading history.
  3. News language is usually highly condensed and comprised of a lage amount of knowledge entities and commen sense.
So the problem is that given a set of user's news reading histories and a candidate news, we need the model to predict the user would click this candidate news or not. So this paper treate this problem as a click-through rate prediction.

**Methodology**. This model is consist of three sub-module: **knowledge distillation**, **knowledge-aware CNN**, **attention-based user interest extraction**. The first sub-module need to be trained in preprocess. The rest sub-modules are trained then together in the influence of the first sub-module. In other words, the DKN model is a two-step model.

**knowledge distillation**. Associate the word in news with predefined entities in a knowledge graph. Based on these
